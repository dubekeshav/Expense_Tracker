@NotNull: a constrained CharSequence, Collection, Map, or Array is valid as long as

@NotEmpty: a constrained CharSequence, Collection, Map, or Array is valid as long as
        it's not null, and its size/length is greater than zero.
@NotBlank: a constrained String is valid as long as it's not null, and the trimmed 
        length is greater than zero.
